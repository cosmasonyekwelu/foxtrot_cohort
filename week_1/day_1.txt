**Foxtrot Cohort - Backend with Python & Django**
**Week 1, Day 1: Introduction & Foundations**

**1. Basic Programming Terms**
*   **Program:** A set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
*   **Programming Language:** A formal language comprising a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java). It's a bridge between human language and machine code (binary 1s and 0s).
*   **Syntax:** The set of rules that defines the structure of a language. Just like grammar in English.
*   **Variable:** A named container used to store data in memory. `name = "Univelcity"`
*   **Data Types:** The classification of data items (e.g., `String` for text, `Integer` for whole numbers, `Boolean` for True/False).
*   **Backend:** The "server-side" of a web application. It handles logic, database interactions, user authentication, and server configuration. The user doesn't see it directly.
*   **Frontend:** The "client-side" of a web application. It's what users see and interact with in their browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **Framework:** A collection of pre-written code that provides a structure to help developers build applications faster and more efficiently (e.g., Django for Python).

**2. Brief Introduction to Python and its Interpreter**
*   **Python:** A high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its clear, readable syntax and its emphasis on code readability.
*   **Python Interpreter:** A program that reads and executes Python code line-by-line. It translates human-readable Python code into machine-readable instructions on the fly. We use the CPython interpreter (the standard and most widely used one).

**3. Areas of Application of Python**
*   **Web Development:** Building server-side logic for websites using frameworks like Django and Flask.
*   **Data Science & Analytics:** Data manipulation (Pandas), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and machine learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
*   **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:** A leading language for AI research and building intelligent systems.
*   **Automation & Scripting:** Automating repetitive tasks like file management, web scraping, and system administration.
*   **Scientific & Numeric Computing:** Used in fields like biology, astronomy, and physics for complex calculations.

**4. Installation of Necessary Tools**
*   **Python 3:** Installed the latest version of Python 3 from python.org. Verified installation using `python --version` in the command prompt.
*   **Git:** Installed Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in our code and collaborate with others.
*   **Code Editor:** Set up a code editor (VS Code) for writing code efficiently.

**5. Introduction to Backend Programming**
*   **Backend = server side** — deals with logic, database, APIs, authentication, validations, etc.
*   Communicates with **front end** (web pages, apps) via **HTTP, JSON, REST**, etc.
*   In Python, backend frameworks (e.g., **Django, Flask**) help build web applications, handle routing, models, views, templates, etc.
*   The backend is the "engine" of a website. It processes requests from the frontend, works with the database, and sends back the appropriate response.

**6. Git, Command Line & Git Commands**

**6.1 Command Line / Terminal / Shell**
*   Basic commands for navigating and managing files:
    *   `pwd` (Print Working Directory): Shows the current folder
    *   `ls` / `dir`: Lists files and folders in the current directory
    *   `cd <directory_name>`: Changes directory
    *   `cd ..`: Moves up to parent directory
    *   `mkdir <folder_name>`: Creates a new folder
    *   `echo <file_name>`: Creates a new file
    *   `rm <file_name>`: Removes a file

**6.2 Git Basics**
*   Git is a **version control system** — tracks changes in files, supports collaboration
*   Common workflow: **clone → edit → commit → push → pull**

**6.3 Key Git Commands**
*   `git init` — Initialize new Git repository
*   `git clone <url>` — Clone remote repository to local machine
*   `git status` — Show file status (modified, staged, untracked)
*   `git add <file>` or `git add .` — Stage changes for commit
*   `git commit -m "message"` — Commit staged changes with descriptive message
*   `git push origin <branch>` — Push commits to remote repository
*   `git pull` — Update local repository with remote changes
*   `git branch` / `git checkout <branch>` / `git switch <branch>` — Branch management
*   `git log` — Show commit history
*   `git diff` — See changes between commits or working directory

**Project Setup:**
*   Created a local folder named `foxtrot_cohort`
*   Initialized a Git repository inside it using `git init`
*   Created this `day_1.txt` file to document learnings
*   Connected the local repo to a new remote repository on GitHub using `git remote add origin`
*   Added, committed, and pushed the changes to GitHub using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
