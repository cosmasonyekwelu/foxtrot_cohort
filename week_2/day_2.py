# Comparison Operators in Python

# -------Logical Operators in Python-------
''''
 Logical operators are used to make more than one comparison.
There are three logical operators in Python: AND, OR, NOT.
AND - Operator-checks if both the comparisons are true.
OR - Operator-checks if at least one of the comparisons is true.
NOT - Operator-reverses the result of the comparison.(Negative operator: makes a value the opposite)

nyse = "done"
# AND Operator
is_all_true = age >= 20 and nyse == "done"
print("AND: ", is_all_true)

# OR Operator
is_one_true = age >= 20 or nyse == "in_transit"
print("OR: ", is_one_true)

# NOT Operator : gives the opposite value
is_not_true = not (age >= 20 and nyse == "done")
print("NOT: ", is_not_true)

value = False
negate_value = not value
print("Not: ", negate_value)

# Strings
# A string is any character or characters  within a single quote or double quotes.
# single_quote_string = 'Hello, World!' : a single line

# triple_quote_string : a multi-line
# triple_double_quote_string : a multi-line

# Data Structures in Python
# Data structures are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
# There are four built-in data structures in Python: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary.
